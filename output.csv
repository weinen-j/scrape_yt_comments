3§"As a CNA working in long term care facilities for over 4 years, I was ECSTATIC to finally see someone spotlight the horrors of this scam industry! 
Our elders deserve SO MUCH BETTER!!!§2xlol-SNQRU"
4§"Ditto I worked in 2 different states as a CNA,  way too over worked understaffed.  Why I'm currently going to school for something else.§2xlol-SNQRU"
5§"the elders are our future selves.That should be motivation for folks to fix this shit before it’s their turn§2xlol-SNQRU"
6§"That is why you should save up in order to be able to afford good care. Good care is costly and we just cannot afford to waste it on everyone. There are just too many elderly ...§2xlol-SNQRU"

13§"As someone who helped take care of one of his grandmothers at home whilst in college and then later my mom, this was a hard episode to watch. The amount of work, stress, physical strain and absolute mental/emotional pain was immense. Did I hate my life during those times? Yup, would I do it all again? In a fucking heartbeat I would. Doctors gave us books and pamphlets but there was never any training involved, just lots of trail and error. It's not like any kind of training could prepare a grandson to hear their grandma cry in pain and tell them they wish they could just die to stop their everyday misery. Reliving that nightmare with mom during her last few months was just agonizing and I really wish we had some kind of better system dealing with long term care for our elderly. I know a lot of people write off old folks for whatever reason but things hit differently when that old person has the face of someone who you know thought the world of you since the moment you were born.§2xlol-SNQRU"
14§"Old people are just a burden.  Very few people have the money to support themselves into very old age.  Old poor people are the worst.§2xlol-SNQRU"

17§"Hi there! EMT here. One thing John forgot to mention: Nursing homes get docked ""points"" every time they need to call 911, so many homes will purposely neglect to call emergency services when a resident desperately needs help. Instead, they'll call a transport service to slowly put-put the patient to the hospital. Trouble breathing? Sharp pain in your chest? Fell out of bed and bleeding? Too bad, wait 2 hours for a transport to pick you up and bring you to an ER waiting room to check you in behind everyone else waiting to see a nurse.

If it's one thing I learned in this field, I pray to God I die before I need to go to a nursing home or an assisted living facility.§2xlol-SNQRU"
18§"@Brad Osborne I can't speak to other states but in texas usually only small town hospitals field ambulances. Most are private or part of the fire department§2xlol-SNQRU"
19§"I fully corroborate everything in this story. I’ve been working in long-term care as a personal care aide for four years. But this line of work came after 20 years as an MSW when I needed an emotional break. There was no break to be had. I was horrified by what I saw and have now committed myself to sticking it out in this low wage work so I can fight for change from within. These companies prey on the low-wage workforce and, in turn, resident care suffers. I’m now working with the SEIU to organize my coworkers to unionize our workplace. PS, you really should add a home care/home healthcare companion piece to this. In my experience, it’s actually worse. Because no one can inspect private homes. There is utterly no supervision and these elderly and disabled folks are completely out of the public eye. Everything falls to the home care aides— least skilled, experienced, and educated workers with the least amount of power in the system, and when something goes wrong, they are hung out to dry.§2xlol-SNQRU"
20§"This is an excellent point. We moved our loved ones into ALF in large part b/c home aide care was not consistent and was extremely expensive once full day care was needed.§2xlol-SNQRU"
